"Modular HTML5 Audio Engine &amp; DAW with custom DSP injection and total session serialization."
OMIKUJI // MASTER_CORE_v18Ultra-Stable HTML5 DAW & Step SequencerOMIKUJI is a high-performance, browser-based digital audio workstation designed for rapid beat construction and live performance. Built on the Web Audio API, it features a unique "Bank" system for pattern management, an external JS-injection architecture for custom machines (FX), and a core engine stress-tested for zero-latency rhythmic precision.🚀 Key FeaturesSWING_FIX Core: A precision-timing engine that supports external .js swing modules for custom groove templates.8-Pattern Bank System: Switch between 8 independent patterns on the fly or use the SONG_MODE block arranger for full compositions.Modular FX Injector: Load external JavaScript "Machines" (plugins) directly into the signal chain.Integrated Recorder: ARM and capture your master output directly to high-quality .wav files.Session Portability: Export entire projects (including samples and FX state) as a single .omikuji (ZIP) file.🛠 Documentation1. The Engine CoreThe sequencer operates on a 16th-note grid ($60 / BPM / 4$).Mono-Trigger Logic: Every track is forced to mono-trigger, ensuring samples never overlap and muddy the mix—essential for clean, lo-fi, and hip-hop production.Swing Offset: Calculated using the formula:$$Time_{final} = NextStep + (SwingOffset \times SecPerStep)$$2. User Interface GuideComponentFunctionBLOCK_ARRANGERDefine the play order of your 8 patterns for Song Mode.PIANO DRAWERExpand any track to access a full melodic grid with octave control.VELOCITY BOXVertical sliders below each step to control individual note dynamics.INJECT MACHINEFound in the FX tab; allows for dynamic loading of custom JS DSP code.3. Workflow InstructionsLoading Samples: Click + TRACK, then use the LOAD button to import any audio file.Sequencing: Click the grid for triggers; drag the velocity bars to add "human feel."Applying FX: Switch to the FX Tab, inject a machine, then return to the SEQ Tab and change the ROUTE dropdown on your track from MASTER to your new FX ID.Recording: Press ARM REC, then START. Once you stop the transport, the EXPORT WAV button will appear.🏗 Developer / Technical SpecsLanguage: HTML5, CSS3 (NIN/DATA typography), Vanilla JavaScript.Libraries: JSZip (Session management).Audio Architecture: * AudioContext -> GainNode (Track) -> FX_Node (Optional) -> Master_Gain -> MediaStreamDestination.Swing Engine API: To write a custom swing module, export a default object with a getOffset(step, amount) function.
